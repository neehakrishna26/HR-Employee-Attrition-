## Overall Learning 

> During this project, I gained practical experience in data analysis and business intelligence by working on an end-to-end employee attrition analysis. I strengthened my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and KPI development using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX. I also learned how to design clean, executive-friendly dashboards that focus on high-impact insights rather than cluttered visuals..
